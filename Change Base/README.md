## Purpose
The code converts a number of a given base to its decimal form. The legal bases are between 2 and 36.

## Execution
1. Compile code and create executable

	`gcc -Wall changeBase.c -o changeBase`
1. Run the executable changeBase

	`changeBase`
1. Enter the base
1. Enter the value you wish to conver to its decimal form.

## Error conditions and assumptions
