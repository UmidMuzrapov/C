## Purpose
The code counts the frequency of number in a given file, from smallest to largest.
It dynamically allocates the memory and stored values in the linked list.

## Execution
1. Compile code and create executable

	`gcc -Wall count.c -o count`
1. Run the executable changeBase

	`count < input`
   or
	`count`

## Error conditions and assumptions
A non-integer value in the input stream causes the program to print an error message and exit with exit status of 1.
